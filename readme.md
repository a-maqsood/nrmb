## Non Recursive Makefile Boilerplate

Currently works with C source code

### How to Use:

1. Copy "Makefile" into the root of project 
2. Copy "submake.mk" in each sub folder 
    
Recommended: create hardlinks to "submake.mk" in each sub folder so that any change in "submake.mk" would reflect in all hardlinks.

That's it. Enjoy :)
